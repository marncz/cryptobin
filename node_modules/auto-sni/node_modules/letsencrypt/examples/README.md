**These aren't the droids you're looking for.**

You probably don't want to use `node-letsencrypt` directly.

Instead, look here:

Webservers
----------

For any type of webserver (express, hapi, koa, connect, https, spdy, etc),
you're going to want to take a look at
[letsencrypt-express](https://github.com/Daplie/letsencrypt-express).

CLIs
----

For any type of CLI (like what you want to use with bash, fish, zsh, cmd.exe, PowerShell, etc),
you're going to want to take a look at
[letsencrypt-cli](https://github.com/Daplie/letsencrypt-cli).

No, I wanted node-letsencrypt
=============================

Well, take a look at the API in the main README
and you can also check out the [scraps](https://github.com/Daplie/node-letsencrypt/tree/master/scraps).

Feel free to create issues for examples that don't work and pull requests if you fix one.

And please, please, do open an issue. We haven't updated the scrap examples
(hence being moved), but we do have it on the roadmap to bring back some raw API examples.
